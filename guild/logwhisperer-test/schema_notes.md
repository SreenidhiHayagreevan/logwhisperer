Table: auth_logs (ClickHouse, read-only). One row = one Windows authentication event in a company network, from the LANL dataset. Covers one full day: 2026-10-08 (call it "yesterday").

In any text column, "?" means unknown.

Columns:
- timestamp (DateTime): when the event happened, e.g. 2026-10-08 14:32:05. Use this for all time questions.
- time (UInt32): seconds since the dataset started, e.g. 742325. Ignore; use timestamp.
- src_user (String): account that started the login, e.g. U66@DOM1.
- dst_user (String): account used on the destination computer, e.g. U66@DOM1 or SYSTEM@C1234.
- src_comp (String): computer the login came from, e.g. C17693.
- dst_comp (String): computer being logged into, e.g. C1234. Can equal src_comp for local logins.
- auth_type (String): authentication package, e.g. NTLM, Kerberos, Negotiate, or ?.
- logon_type (String): how the login happened, e.g. Network, Interactive, Batch, Service, RemoteInteractive, or ?.
- auth_orientation (String): kind of event, e.g. LogOn, LogOff, TGT, TGS, AuthMap.
- result (String): Success or Fail.
- is_attack (UInt8): e.g. 0. NEVER use this column in any query. It is hidden ground truth.

Tips:
- Accounts ending in $ (e.g. C586$@DOM1) are computer accounts, not people.
- People accounts start with U (src_user LIKE 'U%').
- Moving between computers = src_comp != dst_comp.
- Number of different computers an account reached = uniqExact(dst_comp).
- Hour of day = toHour(timestamp).
